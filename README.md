# AppGet is Shutting Down

Given the release of Microsoft [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)
, I’m no longer going to be developing AppGet. The client and backend services will go into maintenance mode immediately until August 1st, 2020, at which point they’ll be shut down permanently.
